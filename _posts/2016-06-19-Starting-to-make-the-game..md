First of all happy father's day to all you fathers out there. I have learned how to tidy up my google drive and have done so. I have also started to make my game. It is difficult. Since I have done all the tutorials I have to give proof that I have done all of them by posting a document with them on onto google classroom. I would highly recommend google docs and classroom as they are very useful. And again to end this blog have a happy father's day.
