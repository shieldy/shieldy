  <tr>
    <td>I learned through trial and error because we were doing flashing lights. We couldn't save it which was really annoying because now I don't know where I went wrong . I also quite obviously learned from the book and the code in it. There was only on that was really effective and that was trial and error because the pictures in the book are very difficult to follow because of the light in them.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were time and the booklet because we couldn't decider the picture and therefore couldn't get on very far. Also the lights and other parts were very difficult to put in the breadboard in the first place so that that took too long for my liking. I need to work on my patience with the pictures and the rest of the text.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try to focus more on the work than how far we are getting so that I don't get annoyed and can at least say to myself I learnt something. I will also ask my teachers only when it is vital otherwise it is wasting their time. I will improve my learning by doing all these things making it harder but more enriching.
