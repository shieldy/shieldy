I now only have the fifth and sixth to do before I can go on to the final three. However I have just found the microbit cookbook which gives even better details of how to do the tutorials. It shows exactly how your code is meant to look on screen. I also found out that you can get versions of the cookbook for the final three more difficult tutorials, which should be very helpful.It is really rewarding when the code you have written actually works, and produces a game that you can play.
