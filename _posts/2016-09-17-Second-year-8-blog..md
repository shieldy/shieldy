  <tr>
    <td>I learned by reading the instructions over and over again and again and also by asking my partner for help. The strategy that was most effective was asking my partner for help when it came to things like the saving a reading and understanding the instructions given in the booklet. I also learned by trial and error because the program "Hello World" is all about learning how to program.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time definitely limited my learning because after we've done all the setting up and putting away of the computers we have only about 35 minutes but sometimes more than that. The habits I need to work on are not just going to the teacher or panicking as soon as anything goes wrong. Asking my partner a lot more and trusting the computer and the instruction booklet.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I will not go straight to the teacher instead I will ask other people for help. Also I will change the fact I panic a lot this will improve my learning because it will be less stressful for myself and those around me creating a much better learning environment. I will also improve my learning by reading all the extra information in the booklet because it's information I will need anyway and will help with my confidence.</td>
