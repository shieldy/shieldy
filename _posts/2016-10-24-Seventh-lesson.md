  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the booklet and thinking about what each individual piece of code meant. I also read the book for hints and asked my partner. The strategy that was most effective was thinking about what each individual piece of code meant then seeing if it related to anything including patterns. For instance I found out that a particular bit refers to type size and I could only have worked that out by seeing the end product with different type sizes.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the speed of my typing. My partner types a lot faster than me so we do the typing on time and not lines. I also need to stop getting so worried at the drop of a het and also need to try typing more often. I need to work on my speed of typing and on the way I type. I also need to take control of my emotions all the time and not think it's the end of the world all the time.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come to the lesson looking forward to I and trying not to think about my past experiences. I will also come and hopefully be a faster type as I have the whole half term to practice. ''This will improve my because it will mean I will be able to get more done in the lesson therefore learning more also the new attitude should help in the lesson by possible boosting my self esteem.</td>
