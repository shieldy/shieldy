    <td>Today I learned by asking my partner what he had done last week and how. He showed me the space invader. I also learned by reading the book because since it was a round up section there was everything in there that had been previously. The most effective strategy was the later because it didn't say unnecessary things and was straight to the point as well as all of it being correct and to the program.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact it was a round up session so all except one part I already knew. Also that my partner was not entirely helpful. I also needed to ask the teacher how to make a picture be the background of my blog which took up a bit of the lesson but was very helpful and meant I could make the changes as soon as I got home. The habits I need to work on are to not let myself get annoyed as easily and to not be all "Hello birds hello trees".</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I would change for next time would be that I would go into the lesson with my chin up and not be all miserable about it ,also to be more patient with my work and not be afraid to give it a go. This will help my learning because it will mean I am more open to my partner also I would be able to do more to contribute to the work and make more of the typing my own . All this should help me have a better next lesson.</td>
