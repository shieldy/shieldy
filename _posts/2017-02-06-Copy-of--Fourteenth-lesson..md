    <td>I learned using codecademy to try and figure out how to use lots of things like how to make the program show the amount of letters in a string make them all caps make them all lower case and also how to make it show one particular letter but it was really difficult because numbers in python star at 0.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time and the fact that a few people were asking for my help which i reluctantly did because we aren't really meant to do so. I also found that it was difficult to remember all the code id lant so i had to look back at the code to see what i had done previously.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I will try other things than just going to teachers for help and also i need self confidence. The fact that i find coding hard shouldn't matter i am there doing it to learn not to know everything already. I will improve my learning by trying as many as humanly possible in the lesson and not think that i can't do it. Also i might try to get out of the look for help to do my work spot.</td>
