  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to make variables that were words and use them to make it seem that the computer was talking back to you we also learned about how inputs are used in that. I'm learned through the book and trial and error and looking through previous files on my memory stick that could help. The most effective strategy work didn't save. The inputs worked by.  $ was used for word variables.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the trouble that was caused because we couldn't save our work so we did a piece of it 3 times each time doing exactly what it said in the book press f5 and it didn't work so we were really annoyed with that. The habits I need to work on are using my brain a bit more and to try things with tiny easy to make bits of code to test. I also need to think outside the box a bit more.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I will try other things than just going to teachers for help and also i need self confidence. Also doing all the things i have said above will help my overall experience of coding and programing computer to do what i want it to do and not loose my long and hard worked pieces of code that then have to be redone. My teacher was kind enough and said i didn't need to do it all again i just had to write about in this. </td>
