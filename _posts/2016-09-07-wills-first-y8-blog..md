    <td>I learnt through trial and error, if I couldn't figure it out then I went back to the FUZE booklet and read carefully. I had one problem which we couldn't fix in that lesson even though we searched up on how to do it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact that the booklets would never have a solution to every problem that could have possible happened so something was bound to go wrong.I need to work on the habit of searching myself and partner of ideas before going for help.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to get into good habits and also bring a memory stick in to save work. This will hopefully improve my overall experience of the lesson.I might also ask my partner to help me when I'm stuck and so obviously I'll help him.</td>
