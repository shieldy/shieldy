Today in my lesson we just got our microbits they are really cool. It's one thing creating the code but another playing on it knowing it was you who created the code. Also we were talking about the most common uses of the internet and also what we were afraid of. Sexting and Revenge porn were common. Here are some links to the BBC articles on them.

In my lesson grooming and pedofilia also came up. Quick update on my game all I have left to do is find a way to code the losing of lives in it.
