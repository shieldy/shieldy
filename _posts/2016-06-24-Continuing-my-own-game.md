Today in my lesson I was doing a survey on how well i think people accept differences of race, religion and sexuality. Also I was continuing with my game. I am making really good headway with it however my blogs have not been so constant. In my class quite a few people have forgotten to do homework or have somehow lost their work. At the moment I'm adding to my script and have handed in what Iâ€™ve done so far. Learning the raw code is going to be difficult because by the end of the microbit programme we will have them with the raw code we will have learned stored onto them.
