    <td>I learned using codecademy to try and figure out how to use the phrases not or and and they work with boolean to answer the ifs and elsifs they are quite difficult to get the hang of in the very long word and number equations that they all come in. i found with these that if i went slowly and treated it like bidmas then i could do them.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time and the fact that a few people again were asking for my help which i reluctantly did because we aren't really meant to do so. I also found that it was difficult to remember all the code id lant so i had to look back at the code to see what i had done previously. I need to work on my speed of typing and memory.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I will try other things than just going to teachers for help and also i need self confidence. I will improve my learning by trying as many as humanly possible in the lesson and not think that i can't do it. Also i might try to get out of the look for help to do my work spot. I also will do more outside of school to help it.</td>
