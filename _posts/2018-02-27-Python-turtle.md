In this lesson we were focussing on a different kind of python. Ith still used most of the same language however the display was different. In the lesson we tried draw shapes using programming. Instead of typing in every single command we used loops. During the lesson i found that i had remembered much of what i had learned during our normal python. This showed when for most of the questions i knew the answer.

This lesson was very fun and also educational as well as i could probably still code what we did in  the lesson. It was all very interesting finding the ways to solve the problems we faced. how ever next lesson i need to try to remember what we are trying to do and code from there instead of copying.

We also played around on 'weavesilk' which is a cool website which you can create funky art on.
