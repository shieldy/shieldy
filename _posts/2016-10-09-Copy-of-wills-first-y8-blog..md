    <td>Since I was not in the lesson I just got the home work. Which was to write a blog and to make at least two changes to my website every week. I changed the colours of some text and other colours but I thought if I started small then worked up to make the changes become big. In the future I'd like to make some more interesting changes and try not to break my blog. The changes might be to get a new background once I've eventually got my head around the script.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was my not being there in the lesson and only being able to confidently make a few changes to my blog. I need to work on my understanding of code and my confidence when changing it. The other thing that limited my learning was the fact I couldn't find colour wheel for css ( a type of code I use for this blog ) for a long time. Overall I need to work on my understanding and my confidence.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I said earlier I will hopefully change my background to a cool picture and make more significant changes to my blog coding. This will improve my learning by giving me a better richer understanding of code and how to fix it as well as change it for the better and not for the worse. Overall I think I did quite well with my changes to my blog and hope to make even bigger and better ones soon.</td>
