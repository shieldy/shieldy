    <td>I had learned a lot about the 'def' function with my teacher and so that really helped when it came to the project we were set. I found listening to what he said and not blatantly copying his work and actually trying to understand it and learn what did what doing in the code. Because we were making a maths robot we also had to find out where we had to import words from.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time because there was a lot to do a little amount of time. We were set it for homework and so i think i will have forgotten a lot when i get to it on my list of homework. I need to as always work on my organising skills more than ever because i've got exams coming up.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The next time i will have forgotten every thing and so hopefully i will be able to squeeze in some revision. I will improve my learning by practicing over the holidays and getting better at coding fluently. I will when i am happy with my repl code post it so you can have a go to. It happens to be in python 3 a very common easy to learn coding language.
