  <tr>
    <td>I learned that I find it difficult to remember all the code, and understanding it in context because we were trying to create two sections of code, both which I was unable to complete in the time available. I found that asking friends for help worked well, and they would give me tips to get me back on track.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time because if i had stuck at it i would have eventually successfully coded. The fact that i really don't understand the code at all didn't help as anything i wanted to do i couldn't because i didn't know what things to use with them. I need to work on my understanding of code and ability to use it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The next time i will have been to see my teacher to ask him about the code and hopefully remember it and be able to use it in future lessons when we are set tasks. I will try and see him again after my next lesson to ask him some questions and also by the lesson after hopefully have coded my first program.
