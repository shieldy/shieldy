In this lesson we were working with pretty raw code which was quite difficult. The code that we had been doing last year i had thought i'd forgotten. We  were trying to cade a simple machine that asks questions and stores the answer in variables for possible use later.

Personally i think that i was trying really hard as i got my code right first time and before a lot of others. I also for the homework tried to remember it and so didn't have to search anything up. Next time my only problem was the temptation to take the easy road and copy my teachers work which i will have to try and resist slightly more next lesson.

Next time i hope we are doing even more complicated coding because i think that i am ready for the challenge. I also hope that unlike last year i won't give up so easily.
