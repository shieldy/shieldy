  <tr>
    <td>I learned by asking friends who had done the same exercise previously, if there was anything I needed to revise before entering the new section after PYG latin. I also learned by searching anything I didn't know the meaning of up on the internet. As always I learned through trial and error, because after all, coding is based on trial and error.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found recalling some of the previous work and exercises pretty difficult because it was quite a while ago, and detailed stuff is sometimes more tricky to remember. I opened some of my previous work on Code Academy to remind myself how to use particular statements like ELSE, NOT, AND and OR.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The next time I will try and look back to previous work a bit less, because I need to be able remember them when I am actually writing code. I will also try and type quicker, as it will mean I can get more work done in the lesson. This will improve my learning, as in future I will be able to capture more complex ideas in the time I have saved.
