The BBC have just released microbits for every child in a particular year in the county. In my lesson we went through what these microbits were and how they could be made to things through programming. We also went through the sorting hat tutorial and after wards we were set to make our own sorting hat but for our school. Once you get the hang of it it can be quite fun so go down to the microbit website and start programming now!
