This lesson we were doing 'procedures' which is where you input a number by calling it and it will do whatever code is in the procedure, but it wont have stored it or returned it to the other block of code so return is needed. This them makes it a function because it is returning something. We also discussed what we call random. It isn't actually because there is an algorithm used that stays the same. This all started with shuffle play, people complained it was not random enough because it kept on playing song next to each other. But it was random so now what we call random really isn't random. This is well illustrated by an online backgammon game which makes it feel like its cheating but actually it isn't it is genuinely random.

This blog i hope to have embed a repl.it ai i am working on, it's terrible but fun. During next lesson i hope to have added some more to it and to have changed my blogs colours a bit. So far i can understand most of the code but i am not sure how long this will last.
