    <td>I learned a lot less because we had a substitute teacher and so people thought that they could do whatever they wanted, and so it was really difficult to concentrate properly. But luckily i and some other friends were able to sit in a corner and do it a lot more quietly that the others. I think the strategy of not fretting and looking through some of the photos id taken of my work helped because then i didn't have to go looking for things id forgot in past exercises.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found recalling some of the previous work difficult and also being on the travelling section and toting up all the amounts of money was difficult. I totaly lost it when i thought i'd gone through every possibility of what it could be that was wrong and found it was a spelling mistake and a capital letter out of place. I need to work on keeping my cool and also my checking skills because they seem to be very brief and not accurate.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The next time we will have our proper teacher back who will reinstate his presence and give us an assessment. I also will next time not get so hooked up by problems that don't relate to the lesson coming to me in the lesson. This will all improve my learning because it will mean i feel more free and less held down.
