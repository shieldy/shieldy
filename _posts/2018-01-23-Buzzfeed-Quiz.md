This lesson we were looking at buzzfeed quizzes and how they can come up with sometimes extremely accurate things with seemingly random questions. It's incredible. In class we were discussing the possible ways in which they were coded. The tree method which is the most tedious because for every answer you pick they have to code another question and there would be hundreds of questions to code. The modal method where the most common type of answer you give is the one they base their answer off. The number method where the extremes are at either end and you add or subtract numbers to fit in a specific bracket of answers.

At the moment I am making my of quiz and using the modal method to do it. Giving each type of answer the same letter and arranging them in a list so the computer can tell which one is the most common. I hope I will be able to do it but I am struggling to figure out how I will be able to get the computer to find the number of letters as that may be confusing. If I am finding it to hard I will use the number method with the answers each spanning a particular bracket.
