  <tr>
    <td>I learned through trial and error because we were doing coding for our blogs and sometimes it wouldn't work and so we had to change the code to fit our own specific blogs and posts. And some our pages just wouldn't accept. W3schools was the best for finding code on it to help us change them. I hope you like the new look.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were time and the fact that you can only make a limited amount of changes for the page to load and to show your labour. The time meant that I couldn't have done other things that I will explain below the reason I didn't blog last time was because I was writing about and grading others blogs. Go check out " jbeast34.github.io â€œ.
His page broke and now looks awesome.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try to focus more on the work and muck around with the tables to change padding and table headers and others and change their rules to make it look cooler and also change more colour and backgrounds till they look really cool and blend better. I think it will improve my learning because when our teacher deletes our repose I can build it up quickly.
