  <tr>
    <td>I learned using codecademy trying to finish the section i was on which involved using not and and or statements which could be confusing especially as the rules for each was different in some annoying way. I happen to use the trial and error strategy a lot especially with the things i can't understand or remember.It isn't useful when i have no idea about anything.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time and the fact that i was really stuck on a piece of work. I didn't want to ask my teacher for fear that he would think i was lazy and not trying so i spent over half the lesson on that. It turned out i had been over complicating it a very common trait in my family.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I will instead of soldiering on through the difficult thing and not asking if i genuinely need help and can't do it but to try and learn more by asking questions and not holding back on the speed at which i take some of the tasks set. Overall get things done quicker whilst learning more asking a teacher when i am actually stuck.</td>
