    <td>I learned through the book because we were using light dependant resistors which were quite difficult to use. Also we used our teachers because of how difficult they were to find. The first was more effective because it new everything about  how they worked and what we were trying to do with the amount of light recepted equaling to a particular sized blob of light on the screen.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were the fact that the light dependant resistors were almost all broken or beyond use any more because of careless individuals. There was also the problem of English and American spelling in the coding of GitHub. I need to work on my spelling as usual and also my ability to help others struggling.</td>
