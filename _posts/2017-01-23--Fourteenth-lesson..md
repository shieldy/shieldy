    <td>I learned using codecademy to try and figure out how to use python. It was very useful because it told me step by step everything i needed to know if i wanted to do the exercise properly. There was a certain guessing element as in that there were some slightly ambiguous parts in the descriptions of what to do. But apart from that i only had to read.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time because i could have started doing some more on the variables but as it always seems to do time caught up with me and so i couldn't start section 2. I need to work on my speed and my willingness to try things that perhaps aren't so narrow minded or single minded. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I will try other things than just going to teachers for help and also i need self confidence. The fact that i find coding hard shouldn't matter i am there doing it to learn not to know everything already. I will improve my learning by trying as many as humanly possible in the lesson and not think that i can't do it.</td>
