    <td>I learned by asking my partner what he had done and working out the rest he told me that in direct mode you can type in "digitalwrite “and"pinmode “and type in thing like (0,1)then if you wired the wires like it showed in the book you could get them to do all sorts of things. Some of you may know that GitHub was broken and so that is why this will be posted late. Also I learned from him that it is possible to post just annoyingly hard to do so.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning was the fact I was not actually there when my partner was doing the coding for “flashing lights” and so I do not know exactly how and what the code he used was. I also probably need to work on my patience because it is very short and it was causing me to be stressed and unhappy with how things were. I also need to work on my collaboration with my partner and I hope that my trying will show.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be there therefore knowing what we did in the lesson and understand it more and better. I will also make sure that I understand everything we did as we go through the lesson. For example why we write (0,1) and others like that. This will all improve my learning and understanding of the breadboard and how it works. It will also mean I have better and happier experience.</td>
