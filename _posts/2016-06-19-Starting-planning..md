Now that I have finished all the tutorials I am planning for a game I will make. At the moment my idea is to make a magic eight ball that works. It would be relatively easy to make. However it turns out that we are allowed to work in pairs so my partner and I have come up with a game called 'Deluge dodger'. In which you are a block and rain comes down from the top of the screen and you have to dodge it by pressing the a or b button to move yourself left and right. It will require a lot of programming and the plan has to be detailed.
