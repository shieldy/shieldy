In this week's lesson we were creating an online shop that would make it as easy as possible for the low paid worker to use. We had to first do two lists the things and their prices. Then we used a vlookup so we could get the price. Then we made it so it time we'd th price by the quantity to get a total for that bit. And finally we made drop down menus so we didnâ€™t have to bother spelling out words.

 

I think I worked really productively as I got it all done and understood it however next time I might want to remember the actual steps with code.
