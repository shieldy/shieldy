I've started doing the tutorials that help someone to learn to code in 'javascriptâ€™. There are nine in total but the first six have instructions built into them. There are progressing levels of difficulty and the last three are even more so. So far i have done three of the six easier ones.

They are actually really fun to do but occasionally they don't work so you have to fix them which is difficult. With the javascript we use a simplified version of the real thing in hopes that in the end we will be able to write proper java.
