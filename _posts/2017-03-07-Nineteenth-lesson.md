  <tr>
    <td>I learned through trial and error because I was trying to get through the exercises as quick as possible and so that I would reach my target and be able to focus on fixing my blog. I also learnt from the hints bar and from the previous exercises I had done. The best strategy was searching up anything I couldn't understand and so learning in the process.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were time and my incessant problem of not remembering any thing so I took photos of anything that I might need to know later. I hopefully won't have to use it but if it comes to it I do have them. I need to work on knuckling down and getting work done instead of doing random thing like talking about how I did an exercise.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will try to focus more on how far I get because I have got to start pushing my limits in my mental and memory capacity so why not in my work. I will also make sure I do my homework properly because the temptation is to look up the answers to the codecademy questions online. This will mean I get more out of the website and learn more complex code.</td>
