This lesson we were using a 'for (i) in range(1,27)' which effectively does a single action 26 times. This is because in python you start at the lowest number, so if all i put was a ten it would still do it ten times but just ‘labeling’ them 0 through to nine. I found all this very confusing at first and so got into it slowly but eventually realised that the i didn't actually mean anything it just made it easier for the computer to compute it.

We also discussed bits and how counting in binary very quickly has its limits and also how it take more space to store it but is so much easier for the computer to understand. I found all of this extremely alien as i'd never done anything like it before. I hope in next lesson i will be able to understand the ideas and concepts easier.
