    <td>Today was not about the booklet it was about our blogs how many changes we had made and what kind of changes they were. I learned about containers from others blogs and how to make them show up from my teacher. The most effective strategy was the second because I did not have to guess what to do. I also am currently learning how to change code properly and hope fully later (on the day I am typing this) I will make the containers show up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was time I did not have enough time to try it out in the actual lesson so hopefully I can give typing in (background: rgba[colour];) if it does not work then I will look on W3schools and look up the body code and try and apply it to c the container. The fact that I generally am very hesitant to change my blog in fear of breaking it does not help at all so I need to learn to take things as they come.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to be bolder and make more changes for instance the HTML coding for the names of the blog posts. Also I will if and when something breaks try to fix it first rather than just asking for help. I will improve my learning by trying a lot more thing that my teachers have said and try to make my blog better because of it.</td>
