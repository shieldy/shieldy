In this lesson we were using chatbots to see what they can do and what some possibilities for the code outline could be. Quite a lot, if they didn't understand, would just repeat some of the sentence back. Also the words around a key word determined the response massively. They are "like parrots repeating things they have heard".

They don't understand what they are saying. Itâ€™s just a string of words to them and can very often result in funny and rude things.

We were also discussing how long. A chunk of code can be and also what the memory on our devices actually represent. Next lesson I hope to do a bit more coding and I also hope to be able to remember it after the Christmas holidays.
