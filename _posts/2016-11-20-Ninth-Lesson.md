    <td>I learned through the booklet and especially trial and error since we were doing true or false we had to get the code perfect or else it wouldn't work. With the code to my blog I had to try three different configurations before I believe it worked. I had to rely on the book in the lesson a lot as we finished the section and went onto programming lights. The booklet however was not helpful I this instant because either I was doing it wrong or the pictures were wrong the light would just not light up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were time and the booklet. The booklet was probably not clear enough and so i could not understand it. We thought that we were making progress until the bell rung for the end of the day. At home it took me a while to figure out what was wrong turned out needed to change the text to caps and and type in an extra number. I need to work on my patience because i can really lose my cool sometimes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will start from scratch when doing lights and read everything properly because quite often i rush thing a lot. Also i will do more research on what i am putting in my blogs code and copy the layout of other things on my blog. I will improve my learning by trying to do more exciting changes rather that regular simple ones. I hope to also change my blogs background to a christmas theme for festivities. </td>
