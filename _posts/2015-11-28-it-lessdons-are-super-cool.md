you'll find your websit at 

your username.github.io

On the Thursday before the end of term I, and a few of my friends, went to compete in the "Lego Robotics" challenge. It was a great experience, with top programmers guiding us around our various events. One of them is even working on a fully functioning robotic arm. We started the day off with a few practices, and then went into our first ever game of FLL (First Lego League). We did OK. Then we had a few more practices, and then some of my friends went off to do a speech on what we had been doing to promote the useage of bins around our school. Then we had our second event, which I took part in - we did even better than the first time, and got a total of 145 points. Then 3 members of our team made a speech on the designing of the robot, after which we had our final game. This one went pear-shaped, incurring all the possible penalties, but despite that we had lots of fun. Finally we went into the team-building game, where we split into two, on opposite sides of a board. One side had to build a tower out of the 30-odd bricks that they had. Then, using the same set of bricks, we had to listen to their instructions so we could build an identical tower, without having seen theirs, or them seeing our attempt. It was really fun.
