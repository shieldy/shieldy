Last time, we talked about how to make your own Blog. This time we are going to talk about common mistakes in the way that people sometimes put things on the internet or social media. Also the way things are sometimes written badly, such as use of inappropriate words.

Some people think that anything they said on social media when they were younger will be ignored. Not true, it has always been saved somewhere. It is also a really bad idea to make "comments" which could be seen as wrong, as you could be identified as the person who wrote them. Recently a lady who had used Twitter to post a very rude comment about someone, had to quit her job in the Police, working with young victims, because of the shame when she was identified. Also, even if you have put private settings on your account, hackers can break the security, and mean that it may not be private at all. 

When people say the word "gay", some kids think it is OK to use it as a term of abuse. They might write that someone in their class that they did not like “was really gay” - a pretty lame insult, as well as being homophobic. They also find it funny when people use that word normally. It does not just mean a man who loves a man, it also can also mean if someone is happy or cheerful, such as “Sunday's child is bonny, blythe, good and gay.”  As some kids unlikely to change, it might be better just to use a different word instead.
