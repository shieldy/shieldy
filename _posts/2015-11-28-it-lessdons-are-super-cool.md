Prezi is an awesome place to make cool and engaging powerpoint like presentations. You can get a free account and try it out or you can buy a better version. However you also can if you are a student or teacher get a special free subscription. In my IT lesson this week we were refining our history of computers projects and so looking at each others and giving grades. It was really cool watching others prezis to see what they would do with it next. Some of them were quite sickening at times. And so that was another lesson.
