  <tr>
    <td>I learned a lot from reading the manual not only the thing it was showing us to do but other things like that. I also learned a lot by asking other pairs if they could perhaps help us do a thing we were unsure about. The strategies that were effective were trusting my gut feeling and also looking back through the book at what we had previously been doing thinking about it doing it and learning from it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was my own impatience and panicking. Whenever anything goes wrong I panic and it doesn't help me or my partner it also brings on my impatience which makes me angry quick to get annoyed and not very nice to work with. The habits I need to work on are being nicer to those around me stop being so impatient and try not to panic so much because it all just goes downhill from then on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that I will change for next time are that I don't get so angry over tiny things and I also do not panic so much as I usually do. Try I get to do the things in this box and above will improve my learning a great deal as it will create a nicer closer more free learning platform for me and my friends. It will also make sure I get on with the lesson and not agrivate or mildly annoy the teachers. </td>
