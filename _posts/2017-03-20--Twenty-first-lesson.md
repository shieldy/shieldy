  <tr>
    <td>I learned by actually trying to understand the instructions and copy any thing they have said to do. Sometimes when i don't understand the instructions i go for another read through or have a go and see what happens. A Lot of the time i can figure out what to do because in the program it gives feedback about what has gone wrong with my code. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found recalling some of the previous work difficult because i have a terrible memory but i am very pleased because during my homework i remembered almost everything i had learned in my lesson. I need to work in trying to remember the vocab used in the instructions and what it relates to in the actual code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The next time i will try and figure everything out for myself and not rely on others for help. I will also write my code with more thought and not just randomly. I will also always read the editor's text fully to try and understand my mistake and be able to fix it. This will all mean that i actually learn instead of guessing.
