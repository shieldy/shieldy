This lesson we started our coding for the quizzes we are trying to make. We are trying to split the code into chunks. This will allow us to alter the code if we wish. The chunks will all be fed into procedures which can then be called and run in a single block. I am finding all of this quite challenging but I hope that will change soon, I am starting to get the hang of how to construct the code which is a step in the right direction but remembering exactly what to type in and where is still beyond me.

So far I am finding this really quite fun because it is just like learning another language only the  grammar is slightly more complicated. This half term I have learned lots to lead up to this quiz making and I hope I will not give up, like previous years, and carry on even if it is a bit hard.
