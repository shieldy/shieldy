We have been using Excel for the past few weeks. We have learnt how to create a code that will automatically encode and decode the code that we put in. We did this by using things like 'vlookup' which effectively allows us to type a singular letter or character in a cell and it will feed back what we have put it to encode as. We also used others to condense into single cells and then another much longer one to separate them.

I have been finding it pretty simple as most of it is shown for you by excel but figuring out what to put in the particular instance can be difficult to grasp. I have also been able to figure out most of it because back in year 8 we did a lot of coding which keys into this as well.

The things that I can improve on are trying to figure things out quicker and finding more concise ways of explaining them. Also I could improve on my listening and notation as it really helps to get the head start.
